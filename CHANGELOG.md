# Changelog

## 2.0.1 - Saddle and Blanket Compatibility Hotfix - Unreleased

### Fixed
- Fixed saddles and blankets not being equippable because their Patchwork model
  patches targeted the document root. Equipment patches now preserve attachment
  sets supplied by compatible skin mods and initialize the set only when absent.

## 2.0.0 - Frost Dragon, Flying Companions, and Animal Equipment - 2026-08-06

### Added
- Added the Frost Dragon as a fully supported Beast companion. Frost Dragons prefer Frost Essence, can fight on the ground or in the air with bites, Frost Bolts, and Freezing Breath, and can be ridden with a custom AvatarFlight model, combat abilities, animations, audio, launch effects, and icy flight trails.
- Added full taming and husbandry support for 17 passive flying companions: bluebirds, sparrows, parrots, ravens, crows, green finches, woodpeckers, brown and snow owls, bats and ice bats, pigeons, ducks, archaeopteryxes, hawks, pterodactyls, and vultures. Their companion panel includes a persistent Ground/Flight toggle, and they automatically land for food, water, sleep, and breeding before resuming flight.
- Added a craftable `AH_Saddle` and owner-only equipment interactions for every mountable tamed animal. Saddles persist with the animal, provide a movement-speed bonus, and can be removed for a full refund.
- Added persistent blankets in all 20 full-wool colors for horses, deer and antelope, moose, mosshorns, and skeleton horses. Recoloring or removing a blanket refunds the previous wool block, and offspring do not inherit equipped saddles or blankets.
- Added petting interactions for tamed Beasts and critters, including happiness gain and species-appropriate reactions.
- Added shoulder riding through the bonded companion panel's `To Me` command for tamed frogs, geckos, meerkats, mice, squirrels, and every supported flying companion except pterodactyls and vultures.
- Added a special Canada blanket appearance for tamed moose named `Flash`.

### Changed
- Updated the required Alec's Tamework dependency to `3.x` and the Animal Husbandry manifest version to `2.0.0`.
- Gave all 32 native ground mounts species-tuned movement profiles, made tamed crocodiles mountable, and gave Tetrabird jumps a slower, glide-like descent.
- Migrated ground and flying follow, flying Hold, airborne transitions, and
  favorite-item pursuit to the shared Tamework 3.0 companion components while
  preserving Animal Husbandry's species-specific tuning.
- Autonomous flying companions now steer around nearby obstacles and return
  toward their owner or combat target when they wander beyond their configured
  range.
- Capped tamed Bluebird flight speed to keep its small-body movement stable.
- Equipment prompts now display the player's bound interaction key. Empty-hand removal prioritizes petting, then removes saddles before blankets, while returning the exact equipped item.

### Fixed
- Fixed flying-companion and Frost Dragon roles failing Hytale validation after
  the shared Tamework aerial-component migration.
- Prevented accidental owner hits from leaving tamed livestock and flying companions with hostile target memory that made them repeatedly flee from or attack their owner.
- Updated tamed livestock food thought bubbles to show each animal's actual preferred food.
- Replaced direct Zone 3 predator spawn-table overrides with local Patchwork patches, preserving compatibility with the base game and other mods while keeping Animal Husbandry's Arctic Fox and Frost Dragon spawn changes.
- Fixed Frost Dragons failing to use Aggressive aerial combat consistently and
  made player-hostile creatures recognize supported tamed Beasts and flying
  companions as opposing targets.
- Fixed Frost Dragon follow recovery failing to teleport because it selected
  the owner's occupied position; recovery now chooses a clear position beside
  the owner without changing Defend or Aggressive mode.
- Fixed aerial companion templates, command policies, and valid landing block
  sets that could prevent birds from following commands or completing flight
  transitions.
- Fixed Frost Dragons displaying the wrong food cue instead of Frost Essence.
- Fixed the Animal Control Flute, Combat Beast Flute, and saddle using incorrect
  icon or rarity presentation.

## 1.7.1 - Mountable Creatures and Telemetry Descriptor Hotfix - 2026-06-30

### Changed
- Made tamed crabs, emberwulfs, lobsters, scorpions, spiders, and cave spiders mountable, with mount anchor tuning for each supported role.
- Updated the telemetry descriptor to the current stats descriptor schema and removed dev endpoint overrides so Alec's Telemetry uses its default hosted endpoint.
- Updated release metadata for manifest version `1.7.1`.

## 1.7.0 - Food Profiles, Companion Inspection Polish, and Package Layout Fix - 2026-06-29

### Added
- Added explicit Tamework food profiles for animals using the neutral, beast, and critter templates, so HUD food displays and feeding logic use each animal's tame food as its preferred food and show compatible crafted feed options after taming.
- Added Arctic Fox localization coverage and a validation script to keep wild and tamed Arctic Fox role names aligned across supported languages.
- Added translated command-flute description guidance that tells players they can look at an animal to inspect it.

### Changed
- Updated food-item README and wiki guidance so crafted-feed happiness notes now point players to the command HUD's per-animal food profile details instead of describing a single generic-feed penalty.
- Updated release metadata for manifest version `1.7.0`.

### Fixed
- Locked deer role gender assignment so `Deer_Doe` resolves female and `Deer_Stag` resolves male before and after taming.
- Locked moose role gender assignment so `Moose_Cow` resolves female and `Moose_Bull` resolves male before and after taming.
- Added wild role coverage to AH breeding configs so untamed Tamework-supported animals can resolve gender before taming.
- Updated critter lure targeting to use player lock-on checks, improving critter response when players hold attractive taming items.
- Moved the telemetry project descriptor to `Server/Telemetry/project.json` to match Alec's Telemetry's updated descriptor lookup path.
- Fixed the release ZIP layout so server assets package under `Server/...` instead of `Server/Server/...`, restoring packaged item definitions such as the Animal Control Flute and Combat Beast Flute.

## 1.6.6 - Critter Needs Template Hotfix - 2026-06-22

### Changed
- Updated release metadata for manifest version `1.6.6`.

### Fixed
- Added the missing tamed critter needs-consume distance parameters to `AH_Template_Critter_Tamed` so direct critter role overrides for trough/source approach and maintain distances resolve through the shared template.

## 1.6.5 - Telemetry Stats and Dependency Alignment - 2026-06-18

### Added
- Added a telemetry consent icon and stats descriptor for Alec's Animal Husbandry so hosted usage summaries can be enabled through the shared consent flow.

### Changed
- Updated release metadata for manifest version `1.6.5`, Alec's Tamework `2.15.x`, Hytale `0.5.x`, and Modtale `0.5.3`.

### Fixed
- Fixed CurseForge release relationships so Alec's Coops and Alec's Nametags remain recommended optional integrations instead of required dependencies.
- Updated hosted telemetry stats routing to the current Alec telemetry ingest endpoint used by the shared rollout.

## 1.6.4 - Dependency Metadata Hotfix - 2026-06-16

### Changed
- Updated release metadata for manifest version `1.6.4`.
- Updated packaged README and CurseForge relationships so Alec's Tamework is the only required dependency, while Alec's Coops, Alec's Nametags, Celly's Baby Animals, and Celly's Wildlife Skins are recommended optional integrations.

### Fixed
- Added load-order metadata so Animal Husbandry loads before Celly's Baby Animals and Celly's Wildlife Skins when those optional mods are installed.

## 1.6.3 - Aerial Companion Alpha and Needs Fixes - 2026-06-16

### Added
- Added alpha support for aerial/bird companions, including Bluebird role coverage and shared aerial templates for flying follow, hold, and landing behavior.
- Added hunger and thirst thought-bubble cues for companions with low needs.

### Changed
- Updated aerial companions to use Tamework targeted landing and flying follow controls for command follow and hold modes.
- Updated release metadata for manifest version `1.6.3`.

### Fixed
- Tuned tamed companion food and water consume spacing per species size so animals stand closer to troughs while still allowing larger mobs enough room to complete consumption.
- Updated tamed livestock, critter, and predator needs seeking to run preflight scanners from idle or hold states, so animals only enter needs movement after Tamework confirms a reachable food or water target.
- Updated livestock hay/food-block seeking to use Tamework reachability preflight before entering movement, reducing cases where animals try to path to unreachable food blocks outside fences.
- Fixed tamed livestock hay seeking so cows, bison, and other companions can detect placed hay by exact block type even when the base blockset lookup does not resolve the hay block name.

### Known Issues
- Bird and aerial companion behavior is an alpha feature; flying follow, hold, and landing behavior may still need tuning, especially around confined spaces and long pathing transitions.

## 1.6.2 - Localization and Packaging Hotfix - 2026-06-09

### Added
- Added bundled French (France), French (Canada), and Brazilian Portuguese translations for Animal Husbandry items, Tamework config text, talents, traits, commands, interactions, and happiness labels.

### Changed
- Updated Animal Husbandry Tamework configs to use `server.lang` keys for player-facing talent, trait, command, interaction, and happiness text.
- Updated release metadata for Alec's Tamework `2.14.x`, Hytale `0.5.x`, Modtale `0.5.3`, and manifest version `1.6.2`.

### Fixed
- Fixed Windows-built release zips so packaged asset paths use game-compatible forward slashes, preventing zipped installs from hiding Animal Husbandry items such as the command flutes.
- Fixed the packaged Tamework dependency range so Animal Husbandry declares compatibility with the Tamework 2.14.x server build used by the latest package.

## 1.6.1 - Harvest Alarm and Asset Pack Hotfix - 2026-06-07

### Added
- Added a 256x256 in-game icon for the Animal Husbandry asset pack.

### Changed
- Updated livestock harvest templates to use Tamework harvest alarms and reset sensors, allowing harvest cooldown talents to scale reset timers without relying on base-game harvest alarms.
- Updated release metadata for Alec's Tamework `2.13.x`, Hytale `0.5.x`, Modtale `0.5.3`, and manifest version `1.6.1`.
- Added the asset pack icon to release packages and expanded optional CurseForge relationships for Alec's Cats and the MMO Taming Skill Pack.

## 1.6.0 - Companion Progression and Talent Trees - 2026-05-30

### Added
- Added Animal Husbandry leveling configs for all 92 checked-in tamed companion roles, split across harvest livestock, non-harvest livestock, neutral wildlife, critters, and combat Beasts.
- Added Animal Husbandry talent trees for all companion archetypes, with more talent options than available points and branching paths for conditioning, care, production, breeding, recovery, and combat specialization.
- Added utility talents for slower hunger/thirst decay, happiness gain, breeding cooldown, fertility, trait mutation chance, appearance mutation chance, harvest cooldown, revive cooldown, and restrained combat scaling.
- Added appearance mutation talent branches alongside trait mutation branches so players can opt into mutation-focused breeding paths without blocking the core breeding line.
- Added separate livestock progression and talent coverage for animals with harvest functionality versus livestock that cannot be harvested.
- Added carnivore and omnivore needs configs, with related feed-item and wiki updates for diet-specific companion care.

### Changed
- Tuned companion leveling around long-term but achievable goals: critters near 15 hours, neutral wildlife near 20 hours without combat, livestock near 30 hours, and Beasts near 30 hours when moderate combat use is included.
- Added 15-minute feed XP cooldowns and raised care/breeding/harvest XP values so regular care matters without letting repeated feed clicks dominate progression.
- Updated livestock harvest templates to use Tamework harvest alarms, allowing harvest cooldown talents to scale reset timers.
- Updated release metadata for Alec's Tamework `2.12.x`, Hytale `0.5.x`, and manifest version `1.6.0`.
- Updated README/wiki documentation to describe XP levels, passive talents, talent trees, traits, and progression config files as active systems.
- Updated taming reference and getting started wiki images to use Markdown image/link markup for cleaner rendering in feed tables and trough instructions.

### Fixed
- Fixed milk and other container-style harvest luck behavior so harvest bonuses can preserve the harvest cooldown instead of duplicating filled buckets.
- Fixed livestock harvest interactions so bucket/shears requirements route through the correct item-specific harvest checks.
- Fixed wolf combat spacing and retreat tuning so white and black wolves retain intended combat behavior after progression template changes.

## 1.5.2 - Soul Lantern Icons + Beast Collars + Update 5 Compatibility - 2026-05-26

### Added
- Added curated Soul Lantern icon coverage and generated icon assets for Animal Husbandry capture/spawn flows, including shared role groups, base-only entries, and Aures livestock variants.
- Added tamed beast collar appearance support for tamed hyenas, black wolves, and white wolves.
- Added German localization coverage.
- Added the Soul Lantern icon batch manifest and source fallback support for regenerating icon overrides.

### Changed
- Reworked Soul Lantern spawner icon override data to use grouped role icon entries with default icons instead of the oversized per-role generated matrix.
- Updated beast taming, breeding/growth, animal taming reference, and glowing purple mushroom spore wiki documentation.
- Updated CurseForge publishing to upload changelogs as HTML.
- Updated release metadata for Hytale server `0.5.0`, Alec's Tamework `2.11.x`, and manifest version `1.5.2`.

### Fixed
- Adjusted Soul Lantern icon framing and replaced the earlier generated icon matrix with curated outputs and batch fallback data.
- Removed tracked macOS metadata files from the release tree so they are not packaged.

## 1.5.1 - Companion Command Compatibility + Memory Book Cleanup - 2026-05-15

### Added
- Added Alec's Cats longhair, shorthair, and bobtail variants to Animal Husbandry command flute and Soul Lantern compatibility.
- Added Celly's Baby Animals as an optional CurseForge relationship for release publishing.
- Added demo server join information to the README.

### Changed
- Updated `manifest.json` version to `1.5.1`.
- Simplified Animal Taming and Beast Taming reference wiki tables for cleaner in-game documentation rendering.

### Fixed
- Tamed Animal Husbandry creatures no longer opt into memory-book category listings, reducing clutter from player-owned animals.
- Livestock mode cycling no longer competes with bucket and shears interactions when players are trying to collect milk, water, or harvestables.

## 1.5.0 - Demo Server Prep + Gendered Breeding Support - 2026-05-04

### Added
- Enabled gender-aware breeding across livestock, neutral, and beast breeding configs, with different-gender pairing required by default and explicit adult gender labels for deer and moose variants.
- Added `AH_Demo_*` spawn marker assets for manually placing Animal Husbandry demo tetrabirds, cows, bison, normal foxes, cave raptors, cave rexes, turkeys, grizzly bears, and black wolves.

### Changed
- Updated release metadata to `1.5.0` and aligned the required Alec's Tamework dependency to `2.9.x`.
- Refreshed the README with the current CurseForge HTML layout, demo server information, wiki shortcuts, item links, and supported-animal coverage.

### Fixed
- Tamed livestock, critter, and predator templates now refresh their leash point when settling into `Idle` or `Hold`, so leash and wander behavior anchor to the current area after command transitions.

## 1.4.4 - Baby Role Coverage + Neutral Breeding Fixes - 2026-04-27

### Added
- Added command and Soul Lantern support for Celly's baby animal roles, including fox cubs, Arctic fox cubs, flamingo chicks, and tetrabird chicks.
- Added an Animal Husbandry wiki custom theme stylesheet for the HytaleModding wiki surface.

### Changed
- Deer doe/stag and moose bull/cow breeding now use complementary adult-role family overrides so those paired variants can breed together and produce either adult role.
- Refreshed the README and Getting Started wiki copy around settings presets, companion care, commandable animals, and planned systems.
- Reworked wiki homepage routing to use the lowercase `index.md` import contract and updated internal links accordingly.
- Aligned README/wiki dependency guidance with the required Alec's Tamework `v2.8.x` dependency.
- Updated `manifest.json` version to `1.4.4`.

## 1.4.3 - Template ID Cleanup + Cat Command Compatibility - 2026-04-20

### Changed
- Renamed the shared Animal Husbandry role templates to the `AH_Template_*` scheme and rewired role/template references plus compatibility notes to match the new ids.
- Pet cats from Alec's Cats can now be linked and commanded with both the `Animal Control Flute` and `Combat Beast Flute`.
- Refreshed the README/wiki getting-started and feed-trough guides with expanded animal-management guidance, corrected screenshots, and broken-image cleanup.
- Updated `manifest.json` version to `1.4.3`.

### Fixed
- Tamed companions now clear their idle settle/sit posture before command-driven movement resumes, preventing sliding when follow/defend/move commands interrupt a resting idle animation.

## 1.4.2 - Arctic Fox Variant + Owner Retaliation Guard - 2026-04-13

### Added
- Added Arctic Fox as a tameable predator variant, including wild glacial/mountain spawns, tamed role support, custom model/texture assets, and full beast-side integration across interactions, needs, happiness, breeding, command items, soul lanterns, and traits.

### Fixed
- Fixed tamed combat companions retaliating against their owner after accidental hits during defend/combat flows or while waking from owner-caused damage.

### Changed
- Updated `manifest.json` version to `1.4.2`.

## 1.4.1 - Coop Fallback Restoration Hotfix - 2026-04-09

### Fixed
- Restored the temporary coop fallback assets (`Server/Farming/Coops/Coop_Chicken.json` and `Server/Tamework/Items/Coops/ACCoopChicken.json`) so coop flows remain stable when Alec's Coops is not enabled.

### Changed
- Updated `manifest.json` version to `1.4.1`.

## 1.4.0 - Multi-Food Feed Families + Timed Feed Happiness - 2026-04-08

### Added
- Added predator-specific needs/happiness config assets (`AHNeedsBeast`, `AHHappBeast`) so tamed predators can consume/use carnivore feed with dedicated impulse mappings.
- Added optional food classification parameters to tamed templates (`FoodFavorite`, `FoodGeneric`, `FoodPremium`) for role-driven feed impulse mapping without per-role config duplication.

### Changed
- Updated command item naming to **Animal Control Flute** (base) and **Combat Beast Flute** (upgrade), and aligned player-facing docs/localization.
- Updated command item progression recipes/bench tiers to the current design (`Animal Control Flute` on Farming Bench Tier 2, `Combat Beast Flute` on Farming Bench Tier 6 with Wild Wisteria log gate).
- Converted the base command item presentation from bag-style visuals/sounds to flute-style behavior and refreshed flute texture/icon differentiation between Animal Control and Combat Beast variants.
- Feed interactions now keep `AttractiveItemSet` as the baseline food family and also accept feed items by cohort (`Tw_Feed_Herbivore` for livestock/neutral/critter, `Tw_Feed_Carnivore` for predator).
- Passive needs consumption now includes feed items in container food ids (herbivore feed for default cohorts, carnivore feed for predator cohort).
- Happiness configs now use timed feed impulses (`HandFeedDurationMinutes`, `FeedImpulseDurationMinutes`) with param/item mappings so feed effects refresh instead of stacking.
- Enabled `HerbivoreFeed` and `CarnivoreFeed` asset-set toggles in `AHGlobal`.
- Expanded tamed livestock group matching for neutral/critter cohorts using wildcard suffixes and restored Mosshorn coverage in livestock interaction role lists.
- Removed the temporary coop fallback assets introduced in `1.3.4`.
- Updated release metadata to `1.4.0` and aligned required Alec's Tamework dependency to `2.8.x`.
- Rebalanced companion happiness around generic feed so baseline care remains below breeding readiness: generic feed impulses are now stronger negatives while active care boosts (hand-feed and pet) were tuned to let players push breeding readiness through intervention.
- Raised breeding happiness requirements from `70` to `80` across passive breeding configs and manual breed interaction gates for livestock, neutral, beast, and critter cohorts.
- Expanded wiki/README coverage for `1.4.0` command and care loops, including dedicated Feed Items + Feed Trough pages, generic-feed happiness penalty notes, and Wisteria-gated Combat Beast Flute progression guidance.

## 1.3.4 - Temporary Coop Fallback Packaging - 2026-04-03

### Added
- Added temporary coop fallback assets directly in Animal Husbandry (`Server/Farming/Coops/Coop_Chicken.json` and `Server/Tamework/Items/Coops/ACCoopChicken.json`) so coop worlds remain stable when Alec's Coops is not enabled.

### Changed
- Updated fallback coop item config priority strategy so Alec's Coops can override Animal Husbandry when both are enabled.
- Updated `manifest.json` version to `1.3.4`.

## 1.3.3 - Tamework Config ID Refactor - 2026-04-02

### Changed
- Renamed Animal Husbandry Tamework config assets to concise `AH*` ids/file names across interactions, breeding, companion, global, happiness, needs, traits, command item, and soul-lantern spawner config files.
- Rewired wild/tamed role assets and shared templates to remove legacy `TwInteractionConfig_*` references and run the Tamework interaction flow through the renamed config assets.
- Updated `manifest.json` version to `1.3.3`.

## 1.3.2 - Alec's Cats Soul Lantern Compatibility + Update 4 Compatibility Cleanup - 2026-03-26

### Added
- Added Soul Lantern capture/spawner support for Alec's Cats roles in `AnimalHusbandry_Soul_Lantern`.

### Changed
- Removed the Animal Husbandry coop override assets (`Coop_Chicken` and `TwCoopConfig_AnimalHusbandry_Coop_Chicken`) now that they are no longer needed.
- Updated release metadata compatibility to `ServerVersion`/`gameVersions` `2026.03.26-89796e57b`.
- Updated `manifest.json` version to `1.3.2`.
- Refreshed dependency install documentation links in the wiki.

### Fixed
- Removed `NextTargetRange` from `AH_Template_Predator` because it no longer exists on the base-game component.
- Increased throw-speed values in shared livestock/neutral templates to satisfy current minimum throw-speed requirements.

## 1.3.1 - Aures Spawner Icons + Neutral Needs Consolidation - 2026-03-24

### Added
- Added Animal Husbandry soul-lantern icon override coverage for Aures livestock/companion variants by wiring attachment-driven generated icon mappings in `AnimalHusbandry_Soul_Lantern`.
- Added animation override hooks across animal and predator role assets to align role animation behavior with current template wiring.

### Changed
- Consolidated neutral-animal needs handling into `TwNeedsConfig_AnimalHusbandry` and removed the separate `TwNeedsConfig_AnimalHusbandry_Neutral` split.
- Updated livestock command-bag item + ingredient visuals to align with base `Tool_Feedbag` presentation.
- Refreshed README/wiki navigation structure and links (index/frontmatter layout updates and current wiki slugs).

### Fixed
- Fixed Tetrabird preferred-food wiring so wild and tamed Tetrabird roles now point to the intended berry-based attractive item + particle set.

## 1.3.0 - Neutral/Critter Cohort Expansion - 2026-03-19

### Added
- Added Animal Husbandry integration for the remaining AH_Template_Animal_Neutral base-game roles by introducing wild override + Tamed_ role pairs for Antelope, Armadillo, Crab, Deer_Doe, Deer_Stag, Flamingo, Hatworm, Horse_Skeleton, Horse_Skeleton_Armored, Lizard_Sand, Lobster, Moose_Bull, Moose_Cow, Penguin, Spark_Living, Tetrabird, Tortoise, and Trillodon.
- Added Animal Husbandry integration for the passive critter/cactee cohort via wild override + Tamed_ role pairs for Cactee, Frog_Blue, Frog_Green, Frog_Orange, Gecko, Meerkat, Mouse, Squirrel, Snail_Frost, and Snail_Magma.

### Changed
- Wired the new neutral-role cohort into Animal Husbandry Tamework role allowlists/config coverage (interaction, traits, companion, needs, happiness, breeding, command bag, and soul lantern capture/spawn lists) plus AH_Livestock_Tamed membership.
- Extended the same allowlist/config coverage to the passive critter/cactee cohort (critter interaction config, traits, companion, needs, happiness, breeding, command bag, soul lantern capture/spawn, and AH_Livestock_Tamed group membership).
- Passive critter/cactee roles now use dedicated critter templates (`AH_Template_Animal_Critter`, `AH_Template_Critter_Tamed`) and a slimmed interaction config (`TwInteractionConfig_AnimalHusbandry_Critter`) focused on tame/feed/breed/mode-cycle.
- Split that neutral cohort into a dedicated Tamework config set (`TwInteractionConfig_AnimalHusbandry_Neutral`, `TwCompanionConfig_AnimalHusbandry_Neutral`, `TwNeedsConfig_AnimalHusbandry_Neutral`, `TwHappinessConfig_AnimalHusbandry_Neutral`, `TwTraitConfig_AnimalHusbandry_Neutral`, `TwBreedingConfig_AnimalHusbandry_Neutral`) and rewired neutral roles to use the neutral interaction config id.
- Spark Living now uses shared Tamework `Want_Food_Charcoal` thought-bubble particles (blank thought cloud + base-game charcoal icon).
- Enabled mounting support for selected neutral `Tamed_` roles (`Horse_Skeleton`, `Horse_Skeleton_Armored`, `Moose_Bull`, `Moose_Cow`, `Trillodon`, `Deer_Stag`, `Antelope`, `Tetrabird`, `Tortoise`) with per-role mount anchor offsets.

## 1.2.0 - Companion Mounting + Interaction Reliability - 2026-03-16
### Added
- Added mounting support for select larger tamed companions, including bison, mosshorns, wolves, grizzly and polar bears, sabertooths, snow leopards, cave raptors, and cave rexes.

### Fixed
- Fixed `AH_Template_Predator_Tamed` so predator interaction prompts/actions forward the configured Tamework interaction inputs, restoring crouch-mount prompts and mount execution for predator companions marked as mountable.
- Restored livestock harvest interactions to require configured harvest interaction context in the shared Animal Husbandry Tamework interaction config.

## 1.1.2 - Livestock Spawn Compatibility Hotfix - 2026-03-16
### Fixed
- Added missing NPC group assets for `AH_Livestock_Tamed` and `AH_Predator_Tamed` so custom attitude groups resolve during startup on current builds.
- Updated `AH_Predator_Tamed` to use wildcard predator role patterns so current builds resolve the tamed predator group without TagSet member warnings.
- Updated wild livestock role overrides to expose tame parameters locally (`IsTameable`, `TameRoleChange`, `InteractionConfigId`) so `AH_Template_Animal_Neutral` children no longer fail asset validation with private-parameter errors.
- Added explicit wild `Mosshorn` and `Mosshorn_Plain` role overrides with local tame parameters so those base-game livestock roles follow the same current-build compatibility rules.

### Changed
- Clarified wiki guidance for manual breeding so players know crouch-feeding with preferred food can trigger breeding immediately when normal breeding gates are met.

## 1.1.1 - Tranquilizer Asset Sets Hotfix - 2026-03-15
### Added
- Added `TwGlobalConfig_AnimalHusbandry` to explicitly enable Alec's Tamework tranquilizer asset sets so the tranquilizer potion, arrows, and shortbow are available when Animal Husbandry is installed.

### Changed
- Refreshed README links to use the current CurseForge URL and cleaner wiki index labels.

## 1.1.0 - Beast Taming Expansion + Command Flute - 2026-03-14
### Added
- Added first-pass Beast role coverage by overriding all vanilla Beast roles (`AH_Template_Predator` lineage) in Animal Husbandry.
- Added `Tamed_` Beast role variants for all supported Beast roles, currently wired to `AH_Template_Predator_Tamed`.
- Added `AH_Template_Predator_Tamed` by copying `Template_Cat_Pet` from Alec's Cats for Beast-tamed behavior.
- Added Beast-compatible Soul Lantern spawner support (`AnimalHusbandry_Soul_Lantern` + filled variant + spawner config) with Animal Husbandry-specific localization and icon.
- Added a new Animal Husbandry wiki item page for Nametag usage and integration context.

### Changed
- Wild Beast role overrides now include taming + interaction wiring (`IsTameable`, `TameRoleChange`, `InteractionConfigId`).
- Added a `AH_Template_Predator` override with Tamework interaction support so Beast tame flows can execute at template level.
- Added missing Beast/command parameter definitions to `AH_Template_Predator_Tamed` so tamed Beast role fields (for example `Tamed_Wolf_Black`) resolve cleanly.
- Added `TargetRange` and `CombatFleeIfTooCloseDistance` parameter definitions to `AH_Template_Predator_Tamed` to fix runtime parameter-resolution errors (for example `Tamed_Bear_Grizzly`).
- Added dedicated Beast interaction config `TwInteractionConfig_AnimalHusbandry_Predator` and wired Beast roles to it.
- Beast taming now requires the target NPC to be below 20% health (`NpcHealthPercent` with `LessThan 20.0`).
- Updated Animal Husbandry interaction and command-role allowlists to include the new Beast role variants.
- Added tamed Beast role coverage to `Needs`, `Happiness`, `Breeding`, and `Companion` config role-id lists.
- `AH_Template_Livestock` sleep wake routing now preserves sleep origin: wake returns to `Idle` when sleep started from idle/follow, and returns to `Hold` when sleep started from hold.
- Exposed `IsTameable`, `TameRoleChange`, and `InteractionConfigId` as parameters in chained Beast base roles (`Bear_Grizzly`, `Snake_Marsh`, `Spider`) so child variants can override tame settings without parameter visibility errors.
- `TwInteractionConfig_AnimalHusbandry_Predator` role allowlist now contains only Beast and tamed-Beast roles (livestock role IDs removed).
- `TwInteractionConfig_AnimalHusbandry` role allowlist now excludes Beast and tamed-Beast roles so Beast handling is isolated to the dedicated Beast interaction config.
- Beast taming now additionally requires `Sleep.Tranquilized`; `AH_Template_Predator` now forces tranquilized Beasts into `Sleep.Tranquilized` while `Tw_Status_Tranquilized` is active and wakes them when the effect ends.
- Added `TranquilizerSleepThresholdSeconds` to `AH_Template_Predator` so per-role tuning can require longer remaining tranquilizer duration (supporting higher-hit tranquilizer thresholds through effect-duration stacking).
- Added `TranquilizerSleepHealthRange` to `AH_Template_Predator` and gated tranquilizer-forced sleep by health ratio (default `[0, 0.2]`, so Beasts only fall asleep at 20% health or lower unless overridden per role).
- Tranquilizer sleep threshold behavior in `AH_Template_Predator` now latches eligibility while the effect is active: once the duration threshold is met, dropping health into `TranquilizerSleepHealthRange` will trigger sleep without requiring an additional tranquilizer hit.
- Updated Beast tamed template spawner item bindings to use Animal Husbandry Soul Lantern IDs instead of cat-specific spawner IDs.
- Updated command-item crafting quality/bench presentation for command bag and Beast command flute (`Uncommon`/`Rare`, Farmer's Workbench tier 2 for flute recipe).
- Expanded wiki index pages to include Nametag under companion utility and item navigation.

## 1.0.3 - UpdateChecker + Art/Docs Refresh - 2026-03-11
### Added
- Added CurseForge update-check metadata in `manifest.json` (`UpdateChecker.CurseForge = 1480275`) so supported clients can detect newer versions.

### Changed
- Updated `manifest.json` version to `1.0.3`.
- Refreshed README shields/badges and added a Hytame recommendation section in the docs.
- Updated `Common/Items/AnimalHusbandry/Shakuhachi.bbmodel` with the latest in-progress model changes.

## 1.0.2 - 2026-03-08
### Added
- New "no-correct-food" tame hint interaction that shows preferred-food thought-bubble particles (`AttractiveItemSetParticles`) instead of silently failing.
- Added Animal Husbandry-themed command item art/model assets.

### Changed
- Updated `manifest.json` version to `1.0.2`.
- Animal Husbandry command bag recipe moved to the Farmer's Workbench and aligned to feed-bag-style ingredient expectations.
- README onboarding and feature sections expanded for clearer player-facing setup and gameplay flow.

### Fixed
- Tame interaction gating now correctly applies untamed-only checks (`IsNotTamed`), so already-tamed livestock no longer show unusable tame prompts.

## 1.0.1 - 2026-03-07
### Fixed
- Added missing files for `AnimalHusbandry_Command_Item`.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-03-07
### Added
- Full livestock integration baseline for Animal Husbandry role coverage.

### Changed
- `manifest.json` version bumped to `1.0.0`.

- `AH_Template_Animal_Neutral` and `AH_Template_Livestock` now use interaction-config-first behavior for overlapping interaction pathways.
- `AH_Template_Livestock` command/needs/breeding/flock bridge behavior aligned to the current Tamework-based V1 design.
- Tamed livestock role arrays normalized for tamed-family flock membership behavior.
- `Coop_Chicken` override now accepts tamed chicken-family role variants while keeping vanilla wild auto-capture parity.
- Breeding cadence tuned for V1 with shorter base breeding cooldown and family-specific growth durations.
