# Systems Overview

Parent: [Gameplay Guides Index](/mod/alecs-animal-husbandry/gameplay-guides-index) | [Home](/mod/alecs-animal-husbandry/)

## Core Loop
1. Tame a supported animal.
2. Keep food/water available so needs are met.
3. Keep happiness above breeding thresholds.
4. Breed and raise offspring through life stages.
5. Use command tools to manage movement, safety, and utility.

### Beast variation:
1. Craft tranquilizer potion, arrows, and bow first.
2. Apply tranquilizer pressure during combat.
3. Trigger tranquilized sleep in the allowed health window.
4. Complete taming flow.
5. Control with the Combat Beast Flute.

## Taming and Ownership
- Ownership is persistent and integrated with companion systems.
- Owner restrictions and command permissions are respected.

## Beast Tranquilizer Flow
- Core items come from Alec's Tamework: Tranquilizer Potion, Tranquilizer Arrows, and Tranquilizer Shortbow.
- Glowing Purple Mushrooms for the potion can be made renewable through [Glowing Purple Mushroom Spores](/mod/alecs-animal-husbandry/glowing-purple-mushroom-spores).
- Animal Husbandry Beast roles use tranquilizer sleep parameters to determine when sleep can trigger.
- This is why Beast taming feels more like a hunt-and-subdue loop than livestock taming.
- Once tame is complete, Beasts move into the same ownership/command ecosystem as other companions.
- Full progression details: [Beast Taming Reference](/mod/alecs-animal-husbandry/beast-taming-reference)

## Needs and Happiness
- Animals seek food and water when configured to do so.
- Feed trough blocks can provide staged water charges for hydration, and compatible bucket items can refill trough water.
- Happiness influences breeding eligibility and long-term productivity.
- Practical care loop details: [Happiness and Needs Guide](/mod/alecs-animal-husbandry/happiness-and-needs-guide)

## Breeding and Lifecycle
- Breeding uses compatibility rules + cooldown + happiness gates.
- Offspring can inherit traits/attachments and grow over time.
- Lifecycle role families map adult, baby, and optional adolescent roles.

## XP Levels and Talents
- Tamed companions gain XP from activities that fit their group.
- Livestock progress mainly through feeding, harvests, and breeding.
- Critters and neutral wildlife progress from care-focused activities, with only light combat XP where appropriate.
- Beasts level the slowest and gain most of their progress from real combat plus long-term care.
- Talent choices are passive bonuses for health, movement, harvest utility, care upkeep, happiness, breeding reliability, revive recovery, or restrained combat power.

## Traits
- Livestock and Beasts can use separate trait configs.
- Beast profile emphasizes combat traits.

## Commands
- Follow, Hold, Idle.
- Home management and recall.
- Optional combat command behavior on supported roles.
- Linked panel includes per-companion `Revive` plus nearby-only `Release`/`Cull` actions with safety gating.
- Supported passive flying companions have a separate Ground/Flight toggle and airborne versions of idle, follow, hold, and movement behavior. They still land automatically for needs, sleep, and breeding. See [Commands and Controls](/mod/alecs-animal-husbandry/commands-and-controls#flying-companions).

## Species Coverage Snapshot
Animal Husbandry fully supports all vanilla:
- Livestock
- Neutral Animals (including passive critters/cactee variants)
- Passive flying animals (17 tameable flying companion species)
- Beasts (Predators)

All of these animal groups are integrated into the same taming, companion, needs/happiness, breeding, leveling, talent, and command systems, with dedicated Beast combat/taming flow where applicable.
- Mounting capability is available on all Livestock, Neutral Wildlife, and Beasts that could reasonably support a rider. See [Mountable Mobs Reference](/mod/alecs-animal-husbandry/mountable-mobs-reference).
