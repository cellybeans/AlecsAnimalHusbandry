# Breeding and Growth Guide

Parent: [Gameplay Guides Index](/mod/alecs-animal-husbandry/gameplay-guides-index) | [Home](/mod/alecs-animal-husbandry/)

This page is your practical timing reference for line planning.

## How Breeding Starts
Breeding is **passive by default**. 

When two compatible animals (adult male and female of same species) meet breeding requirements, they will periodically produce offspring on their own. 

You can also crouch and feed [favorite food](/mod/alecs-animal-husbandry/animal-taming-reference) to breed manually. 

This is useful when:
- You want to breed a specific pair immediately.
- You have disabled passive breeding.

## How Breeding Is Gated
Your breeding pair must pass all of these checks:
- Tamed
- Adult
- One male, one female
- Not in combat
- Not sleeping
- Happiness above 80%
- Not on cooldown
- Not overcrowded

Manual breeding still respects these gates.
If crouch-feeding does not start breeding, the animal is usually blocked by one of the checks above.

Flying companions use the same breeding gates. They land before pairing and return to Flight mode after breeding if it remains selected. Keep clear ground near the pair so both companions can complete the landing and approach.

## Litter Size, Capacity, and Pending Births

Fertility intentionally rolls a litter from **zero through four offspring**. Zero is a normal biological result, not necessarily an error or a duplicated callback.

Manual and passive breeding use the same birth-job and capacity rules:

- `MaxNearbySameType` is a hard execution-time ceiling.
- Live nearby animals and children reserved by other pending litters both consume headroom.
- If a planned litter is larger than the remaining headroom, only the admitted number can spawn.
- One parent can belong to only one active birth job, and a job can claim its spawn callback only once.
- Capturing either parent into a Tamework-managed coop before birth cancels the pending job; the delayed callback also checks that both parents are still valid before spawning.

Example: with a maximum of eight matching animals, seven already nearby, and a rolled litter of four, only one child is admitted. Two pairs starting near the limit share the same reservations, so their combined result cannot exceed the cap.

## Livestock Breeding and Growth Reference
After breeding, animals will be unable to breed for the duration of their breeding cooldown.

Default livestock pairing/cooldown profile:
- Base cooldown: **45 minutes**
- Random delay: **0-300 sec**
